Q6.Describe the purpose and usage of the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs in web development. Give
suitable examples for each.


The localStorage and sessionStorage APIs are part of the Web Storage API, 
which provide mechanisms for storing data on the client side (within the browser) 
in a key-value format. They allow web applications to store data that persists beyond
 a single page reload or session, offering a more robust solution than cookies for client-side storage.

 1. localStorage API: 

Purpose:
   localStorage is used to store data persistently in the browser. The data saved in localStorage does not expire; 
   it remains available even after the browser is closed or the computer is restarted. This makes it ideal for storing data that should be retained across multiple sessions,
    such as user preferences or settings.
Usage:
  Data is stored as key-value pairs, where both the key and value are strings. localStorage can store
   up to approximately 5â€“10 MB of data (depending on the browser).


2. sessionStorage API:

Purpose:
    sessionStorage is used to store data for a single browsing session.
     The data is cleared when the browser tab or window is closed, making it ideal for storing 
     temporary data that only needs to exist during the user's current session, such as form input data or transient UI states.
Usage:
  Similar to localStorage, data is stored as key-value pairs in string format, and 
  can hold up to approximately 5 MB of data per origin (domain).
